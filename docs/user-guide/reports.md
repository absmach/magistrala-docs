## Timezone Configuration

The Reports service supports timezone-aware timestamp display in generated reports. This allows users to view all timestamps in their preferred timezone rather than UTC.

### How to Use Timezones

When creating or scheduling a report, you can specify a timezone in the **Configuration** section:

1. Enter a valid IANA timezone name in the **Timezone** field (e.g., "America/New_York", "Europe/Paris", "Asia/Tokyo")
2. If left empty, the report will default to UTC
3. The timezone applies to:
   - Report generation timestamps (shown in headers and footers)
   - All message timestamps in both PDF and CSV formats

### Supported Timezone Formats

The service accepts IANA timezone names, such as:
- **Americas**: "America/New_York", "America/Los_Angeles", "America/Chicago"
- **Europe**: "Europe/London", "Europe/Paris", "Europe/Berlin"
- **Asia**: "Asia/Tokyo", "Asia/Shanghai", "Asia/Dubai"
- **Australia**: "Australia/Sydney", "Australia/Melbourne"
- **Africa**: "Africa/Cairo", "Africa/Johannesburg"

**Note:** Invalid timezone names will fall back to UTC automatically, and a warning will be logged.
