Control Cards are interactive widgets that allow a user to send commands directly to connected devices through a selected channel. These cards provide an intuitive interface for real-time device control within the dashboard.

There are two types of Control Cards:

- **Switch Cards** – for sending boolean values (ON/OFF)

- **Slider Cards** – for sending numeric values (e.g., volume, power)

---

## Switch Card

The **Switch Card** allows a user to send boolean values (**true** or **false**) to a connected client via a channel. This is useful for devices that support simple on/off behavior, such as relays, motors, or lights.

### Create a Switch Card

To create a Switch Card:

1. Ensure the dashboard is in **Edit Mode**.
2. Click the Add Widget button and select **Switch**.
3. The **Create Switch dialog** will appear.

#### Switch Conclusion

Switch Cards are ideal for simple device control:

- Toggle ON/OFF commands
- Real-time interaction with devices
- Configurable titles, value names, and channels

## Slider Control

The **Slider Card** allows a user to send numeric values to a connected device through a channel. It’s perfect for use cases such as adjusting **temperature**, **voltage**, or **fan speed**.

### Create a Slider Card

To create a Slider Card:

- Ensure the dashboard is in Edit Mode.
- Click the Add Widget button and select Slider.
- The Create Slider dialog will appear.
