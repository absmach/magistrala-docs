## Domain Information

Navigate to the `Domain` section in the side navigation under **Domain Management** to find out more about the domain.

Here, a user can edit the Domain **Name**, **Alias**, **Tags**, **Metadata** and **Logo** as well as copy the Domain ID.

The Domain status can be disabled by clicking the `Disable` button or enabled by the `Enable` button. Disabling the domain will revoke access for users who aren't domain admins.

## Domain Roles

## Domain Members

A domain admin or a member with the right permissions can assign users to a domain.
Members must be assigned specific roles.
Domain members have permissions over different entities depending on the role assigned to them. For example, members without read permissions aren't able to view specific entities within the domain.

### Assign Users

To assign a user to a domain, click the `Assign User` button, and then select a user along with their respective roles.
Alternatively, the user can be added while creating the domain role.

### Unassign Users

To unassign a user click the `trash` icon on the member row to be unassigned and confirm the action.
