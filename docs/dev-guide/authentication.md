## User authentication

For user authentication Magistrala uses **Authentication** keys. There are two types of authentication keys:

- `User key` - **Access Token** or keys issued to the user upon login request
- `Recovery key` - "**Refresh Token**" or "**Password Recovery Key**"

Authentication keys are represented and distributed by the corresponding [JWT][jwt]. User keys are issued when user logs in. Each user request (other than registration and login) contains user key that is used to authenticate the user.

Recovery key is the password recovery key. It's short-lived token used for password recovery process.

The following actions are supported:

- create (all key types)
- verify (all key types)

**Example of the tokens:**

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MzkyOTQxMjcsImlhdCI6MTczOTI5MDUyNywiaXNzIjoic3VwZXJtcS5hdXRoIiwidHlwZSI6MCwidXNlciI6IjZjY2FmMTNjLWVmODgtNGNmMi04ZTNhLWM3YzA0YzVlYWY5YiJ9.Qot3ZoqC1enhAS3YEJY3WJioMAJnr98laBGsJzSgF2Zege5pVqILVLcPZzRBmHdIPys4diAGbqRQQzfW_k_Huw",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3MzkzNzY5MjcsImlhdCI6MTczOTI5MDUyNywiaXNzIjoic3VwZXJtcS5hdXRoIiwidHlwZSI6MSwidXNlciI6IjZjY2FmMTNjLWVmODgtNGNmMi04ZTNhLWM3YzA0YzVlYWY5YiJ9.EcRH3DUZcplHz-9Ry_90kSQKLwAWXPww9XfMZ9beoEJItpY39g5-n7vnTyLkRhOp6Pw6aZbfuhOL3TWIE-Q13A"
}
```

## Federated authentication

Federated authentication allows users to sign in to Magistrala using external identity providers such as **Google** through the **[OpenID Connect (OIDC)][oidc]** protocol.

Magistrala acts as an **OIDC resource provider**, while the **[Google Identity Platform][google-identity-platform]** is used as the identity provider (IdP).  
This integration enables seamless, secure sign-in without requiring users to manually create or manage passwords.

### Prerequisites

Before configuring Magistrala for Google Sign-In:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create a **new project** (or use an existing one).
3. Enable the **Google Identity Platform API**.
4. Configure the **OAuth consent screen** and **create OAuth 2.0 credentials** by following Google’s [documentation][google-identity-platform-docs].
5. Add your authorized redirect URIs (see below).

### Authorized Redirect URIs

Add the following redirect URIs to your Google Cloud project:

| Environment          | Redirect URI                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Local Development** | `http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google`    |
| **Production**        | `https://<your-domain>/oauth/callback/google`    |

> These URLs must match the value of `SMQ_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL` in your `.env` or Docker Compose configuration.

#### Environment Variables

Both the **Magistrala backend** and **Magistrala UI** require the following environment variables to be set:

```bash
# Google OAuth credentials
SMQ_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
SMQ_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
SMQ_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google
SMQ_GOOGLE_STATE=pGXVNhEeKfycuBzk5InlSfMlEU9UrhlkTUOSqhsgDzXP2Y4RsN

# UI OAuth redirect handling
SMQ_OAUTH_UI_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/token
SMQ_OAUTH_UI_ERROR_URL=http://localhost:3000/login

# Magistrala UI configuration
MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
MG_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google
MG_GOOGLE_STATE=pGXVNhEeKfycuBzk5InlSfMlEU9UrhlkTUOSqhsgDzXP2Y4RsN
```

>> These credentials must be identical in both the backend and UI configurations to ensure proper OIDC flow.

### Variable Descriptions

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                         |

| **`SMQ_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL`**   | OAuth 2.0 callback endpoint for the SuperMQ backend. Must match the authorized redirect URI in your Google project. |
| **`SMQ_GOOGLE_STATE`**          | Random unique string to protect against CSRF attacks during OAuth flow.                                             |
| **`SMQ_OAUTH_UI_REDIRECT_URL`** | URL where the UI receives tokens after successful authentication (e.g., NextAuth `/api/auth/token`).                |
| **`SMQ_OAUTH_UI_ERROR_URL`**    | Fallback URL for failed authentications (e.g., login page).                                                         |
| **`MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`**       | Google OAuth 2.0 client ID used by the Magistrala UI for initialization.                                            |
| **`MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`**   | Google OAuth 2.0 client secret used by the Magistrala UI for initialization.                                        |
| **`MG_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL`**    | Redirect URL used by the UI to align with backend callback.                                                         |
| **`MG_GOOGLE_STATE`**           | Must match backend’s Google OAuth state value.                                                                      |

#### Flow Overview

1. The user clicks **Sign in with Google** on the Magistrala UI.  
2. The UI redirects the user to **Google’s OAuth consent screen**.  
3. After successful authentication, Google redirects to  
   **`MG_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL`** (for example, `http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google`).  
4. The backend exchanges the **authorization code** for a Google **access token**.  
5. Using the token, Magistrala retrieves basic user info (ID, name, email, profile picture).  
6. The user is created in Magistrala’s database (if new) and authenticated.  
7. Magistrala issues its own **access token** and **refresh token**, stored securely as **HTTP-only cookies**.  
8. The user is redirected to **`SMQ_OAUTH_UI_REDIRECT_URL`**.

- The **`access_token`** from Google is **never stored** in the Magistrala database.  
- The **`id_token`** is not reused to avoid refresh limitations — Magistrala issues its own tokens instead.  
- Always use **HTTPS** for production redirect URLs.  
- Ensure **`MG_GOOGLE_STATE`** is sufficiently random and unique across environments.

#### Example Local Setup

For a local Docker-based environment, add the following lines to your .env or docker-compose.env:

```bash
## In the SMQ

SMQ_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=985229335584-m2mft8lqbgfn5gfw9ftrm3r2sgu4tsrw.apps.googleusercontent.com
SMQ_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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WYUIpw
SMQ_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google
SMQ_GOOGLE_STATE=pGXVNhEeKfycuBzk5InlSfMlEU9UrhlkTUOSqhsgDzXP2Y4RsN
SMQ_OAUTH_UI_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/token
SMQ_OAUTH_UI_ERROR_URL=http://localhost:3000/login

# In the UI

MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=985229335584-m2mft8lqbgfn5gfw9ftrm3r2sgu4tsrw.apps.googleusercontent.com
MG_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=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WYUIpw
MG_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:9002/oauth/callback/google
MG_GOOGLE_STATE=pGXVNhEeKfycuBzk5InlSfMlEU9UrhlkTUOSqhsgDzXP2Y4RsN

```

Finally restart your containers after editing the `.env` file

### Backend Integration

Magistrala handles authentication callbacks at:

```bash
<MG_BASE_URL>/google-callback
```

Where `<MG_BASE_URL>` is your backend users service URL (for example, `http://localhost:9002`).
This endpoint must be registered in your Google Cloud Console and match the value of `MG_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL`.

In case of an authentication error, the backend appends a query parameter `?error=<message>` to the redirect URL.
The UI reads this parameter and displays a corresponding toast or alert.

### Token Management

After Google authentication:

- Magistrala fetches the user’s Google profile (id, email, name, picture, locale).
- A new Magistrala user entry is created if none exists.
- Magistrala issues its own secure session tokens:
  - access_token — short-lived token for API access.
  - refresh_token — longer-lived token stored in an HTTP-only cookie.

These tokens are used for subsequent API calls across the platform.

## Authentication with Magistrala keys

By default, Magistrala uses Magistrala Client secret for authentication. The Client secret is a secret key that's generated at the Client creation. In order to authenticate, the Client needs to send its secret with the message. The way the secret is passed depends on the protocol used to send a message and differs from adapter to adapter. For more details on how this secret is passed around, please check out [messaging section][messaging]. This is the default Magistrala authentication mechanism and this method is used if the composition is started using the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

## Mutual TLS Authentication with X.509 Certificates

In most of the cases, HTTPS, WSS, MQTTS or secure CoAP are secure enough. However, sometimes you might need an even more secure connection. Magistrala supports mutual TLS authentication (_mTLS_) based on [X.509 certificates][rf5280]. By default, the TLS protocol only proves the identity of the server to the client using the X.509 certificate and the authentication of the client to the server is left to the application layer. TLS also offers client-to-server authentication using client-side X.509 authentication. This is called two-way or mutual authentication. Magistrala currently supports mTLS over HTTP, WS, MQTT and MQTT over WS protocols. In order to run Docker composition with mTLS turned on, you can execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
AUTH=x509 docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Mutual authentication includes client-side certificates. Certificates can be generated using the simple script provided in the [SSL Makefile][ssl-makefile]. In order to create a valid certificate, you need to create Magistrala client using the process described in the [provisioning section][provision]. After that, you need to fetch created client secret. Client secret will be used to create x.509 certificate for the corresponding client. To create a certificate, execute the following commands:

```bash
cd docker/ssl
make ca CN=<common_name> O=<organization> OU=<organizational_unit> emailAddress=<email_address>
make server_cert CN=<common_name> O=<organization> OU=<organizational_unit> emailAddress=<email_address>
make client_cert CLIENT_SECRET=<client_secret> CRT_FILE_NAME=<cert_name> O=<organization> OU=<organizational_unit> emailAddress=<email_address>
```

These commands use [OpenSSL][openssl] tool, so please make sure that you have it installed and set up before running these commands. The default values for Makefile variables are

```env
CRT_LOCATION = certs
CLIENT_SECRET = d7cc2964-a48b-4a6e-871a-08da28e7883d
O = Magistrala
OU = magistrala
EA = info@magistrala.com
CN = localhost
CRT_FILE_NAME = client
```

Normally, in order to get clients running, you will need to specify only `CLIENT_SECRET`. The other variables are not mandatory and the termination should work with the default values.

- Command `make ca` will generate a self-signed certificate that will later be used as a CA to sign other generated certificates. CA will expire in 3 years.
- Command `make server_cert` will generate and sign (with previously created CA) server cert, which will expire after 1000 days. This cert is used as a Magistrala server-side certificate in usual TLS flow to establish HTTPS or MQTTS connection.
- Command `make client_cert` will finally generate and sign a client-side certificate and private key for the client.

In this example `<client_secret>` represents secret of the client and `<cert_name>` represents the name of the certificate and key file which will be saved in `docker/ssl/certs` directory. Generated Certificate will expire after 2 years. The key must be stored in the x.509 certificate `CN` field. This script is created for testing purposes and is not meant to be used in production. We strongly recommend avoiding self-signed certificates and using a certificate management tool such as [Vault][vault] for the production.

Once you have created CA and server-side cert, you can spin the composition using:

```bash
AUTH=x509 docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Then, you can create user and provision clients and channels. Now, in order to send a message from the specific client to the channel, you need to connect client to the channel and generate corresponding client certificate using aforementioned commands. To publish a message to the channel, client should send following request:

### WSS

```javascript
const WebSocket = require("ws");
// Do not verify self-signed certificates if you are using one.
process.env.NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = "0";
// Replace <channel_id> and <client_secret> with real values.
const ws = new WebSocket(
  "wss://localhost/ws/m/<domain_id>/c/<channel_id>?authorization=<client_secret>",
  // This is ClientOptions object that contains client cert and client key in the form of string. You can easily load these strings from cert and key files.
  {
    cert: `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----....`,
    key: `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----.....`,
  }
);
ws.on("open", () => {
  ws.send("someclient");
});
ws.on("message", (data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
ws.on("error", (e) => {
  console.log(e);
});
```

As you can see, `Authorization` header does not have to be present in the HTTP request, since the secret is present in the certificate. However, if you pass `Authorization` header, it _must be the same as the key in the cert_. In the case of MQTTS, `password` filed in CONNECT message _must match the key from the certificate_. In the case of WSS, `Authorization` header or `authorization` query parameter _must match cert key_.

### HTTPS

```bash
curl -sS -i \
  --cacert docker/ssl/certs/ca.crt \
  --cert docker/ssl/certs/<client_cert_name>.crt \
  --key docker/ssl/certs/<client_cert_key>.key \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/senml+json" \
  https://localhost/http/m/{domain_id}/c/{channel_id} \
  -d @- <<EOF
