## Domain Information

Navigate to the `Domain` section in the side navigation under **Domain Management** to find out more about the domain.

Here a user can edit the Domain Name, Alias, Tags and Metadata as well as copy the Domain ID.

The Domain status can be disabled by clicking the `Disable` button or enabled by the `Enable` button. Disabling the domain will revoke the access for users who are not domain admins.

## Domain Roles

From the roles section of the domain, the user can create new roles with varying role actions.

By default, an admin role with complete control over the domain is always present and granted to the Domain creator.
