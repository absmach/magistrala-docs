This section will detail management and grouping of clients. It will explain how to manage clients, connect them to channels, manage those channels, group clients and channels to groups and give specific people access to all these entities.

We mostly handle client and channel management from within a group as will be seen later on.

**Clients** can be an device or an application in your organization. **Groups** can be anything depending on the context of your organization. Similar case to **channels**. When connected to channels, clients are able to **publish** or **subscribe** to messages in that particular channel.
