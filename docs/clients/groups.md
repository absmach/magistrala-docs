**Groups** in Magistrala can be anything really. They are used to group clients and channels together. This enables assigning of users to a group of channels and clients with a particular role.

## Create a Group

To create a group, click on the `+ Create` button present on the top-left corner of the page. You can also create multiple groups by uploading a _.csv_ file with group **names** and any other fields you would like to add.

![Create group](../img/clients/group-create-button.png)

### Group Information

Add a group _name_ and optionally a _description_, _metadata_ and a _parent group_.

![Group information](../img/clients/group-information.png)

The parent group would add hierarchy to the group making it a child of the parent group you have selected. Actions within a role in the parent group trickle down to the children groups.

## View a Group

After creating a group, it will show up on the page as the first group created.

> The family tree section shows a group's parent-child relationship (This feature is still under development :hammer: )

## Update a Group

While on the View Group Page, you are allowed to update the group details such as the name, description, metadata and the status.  
To update a field, click on the `pencil` icon on the far end of the field to edit. Once you have updated the value, click on the `tick` icon to update the changes or the `cross` icon to cancel the change.

A group can also be disabled or enabled by toggling the switch on the far end of the status field.

### Roles

#### Create

Roles allow you to group a specific set of actions and allocate them to users.
To create a role, navigate to the roles section on the group navbar. Click on the `+ Create` button and provide a role name. The actions and members are optional fields.

### Users

We can assign a user to a group by adding them as role members. This allows a user to be able to carry out the actions present in the role over the specific group.  
To add role members, one can add them when creating a role or in the specific role page.  
To add a user while in the role page, click on the pencil icon on the far end of the `Role Members` field, search for a user based on their username, and click on the user. Then click on `Add` to add them to the role.

![Add Group Member](../img/clients/group-role-member.png)

Optionally, we have the capacity to add users by assigning them to a group in the users section of the group. This will allow you to assign a user to a group by adding them to a specific role.
