#### Configuring the Count Card

1. **Entity Type**: Select the type of entity to count in the card. The available  options are:
   - **Client** (device)

   - **Member**
   - **Group**

2. **Entity Status**: Choose whether to count only enabled entities, disabled entities, or both.
3. **Tag**: Optionally, filter the entities by specifying a tag. Only entities with the selected tag will be counted.
4. **Update Interval**: Set how frequently the card should refresh to display the latest count. For example, an interval of `60` seconds will refresh the card every minute.

5. **Title**: Enter a title for the count card, which will appear at the top of the widget.

Once all fields are completed, click the `Create` button to add the Count Card to the dashboard.

The card will immediately display the total count of entities based on the selected data source and filters. It will also display:

- **Status**: The status of the counted entities (enabled or disabled).
- **Tag**: The tag value, if a tag filter was applied.
