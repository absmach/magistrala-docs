### Upload Dashboard

Magistrala allows dashboards to be uploaded in .JSON format.

By clicking the `Upload` button at the top of the dashboard table, a dialog box will open, allowing users to select and upload a _.JSON_ file containing the required fields for a complete dashboard.
> Ensure the file contains dashboard **name**, **layout**, and **metadata**.  

The uploaded dashboard will then appear in the list with the uploaded data.
