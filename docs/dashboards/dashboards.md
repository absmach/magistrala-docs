### Create a New Dashboard

After loging into a **Domain**, navigate to **Dashboards** tab and click on the '+ Create' button. The dialog box that pops up will require you specifically add a Dashboard name. The tags and description not neccesary but it is good practise to have them for easier filtering.

### Upload Dashboard

Magistrala provides users with the ability upload Dashboards.

The 'Upload' button at the top of the Dashboard tables triggers a dialogbox which allows a user to upload a _.JSON_ file that has all the required fields of a complete Dashboard. The Uploaded Dashboard will then be created as a new in the Dashboards list with new IDs.
