## **Marker Map**

**Marker Maps** are used to visualize the locations of entities, such as devices or channels, on a map. This makes them particularly useful for tracking the geographical locations of various IoT assets in a visual interface.

Marker Maps work by retrieving latitude and longitude data from the metadata of the entities. A typical metadata entry for an entity’s location might look like this:

```json
{
  "location": {
    "latitude": 27.181212503119802,
    "longitude": 78.04195101133526
  }
}
```

These coordinates are then used to place a marker on the map. Users can add multiple data sources, such as different devices or channels, to visualize them on the same map.

### Create a Marker Map

To create a Marker Map, ensure that the dashboard is in **Edit Mode**. Then, click the `Add Widget` button and select **Marker Map** from the list of available widgets.

#### Conclusion

Marker Maps offer an intuitive way to visualize the physical locations of IoT devices or channels on a dashboard. The flexibility to add multiple data sources, customize markers, and retrieve position data from metadata or messages ensures that this widget is adaptable to various use cases. By integrating real-time location data, Marker Maps enable users to track and monitor their assets effectively.

## **Route Map**

**Route Maps** display the path or movement of a device or entity based on the location messages sent over time. Unlike Marker Maps, which rely on metadata, Route Maps depend on message data from a connected channel-client pair. These messages contain latitude and longitude values, which are used to trace the route on the map. This feature is particularly useful for tracking the movement of devices over time.

### How Route Maps Work

Route Maps visualize location data by retrieving it from messages sent through a channel. The process for sending messages is covered in [getting-started](getting-started.md).
To use Route Maps, navigate to the messages tab of a channel that has connected clients. For Route Maps, it is crucial to use `location` as the value name, and the value type must be string. The message should contain the location data in the following format (as a string):

`{"latitude":-1.206367, "longitude":36.905012}`

  ![Sending Route Location Messagae](../img/dashboards/send-location-message.png)

These location values are used to plot the device's movement on the map. The latest message will indicate the current location, while previous messages will form the route path.

### Create a Route Map

To create a Route Map, ensure that the dashboard is in **Edit Mode**. Click the  `Add Widget` button and select Route Map from the list of available widgets.

This will open the **Create Route Map** dialog, where users can configure the data sources and appearance of the map.

#### Settings Section

1. **Time Window**: In the advanced settings, you can define a time range (`From Date` and `To Date`). This setting will limit the messages displayed on the map to a specific time interval. The route will display all the messages sent within this window, with the pointer indicating the last message before the `To Date` timestamp.  
2. **Update Interval**: Set how frequently the map should refresh to display new messages.  
3. **Title**: Set a title for the map (e.g., "Device Route"). This title will appear at the top of the map.  
4. **Latitude Key**: Specify the key in the message that contains the latitude value. By default, this is set to `latitude`, but you can modify it if your message uses a different key.  
5. **Longitude Key**: Specify the key in the message that contains the longitude value. The default is `longitude`, but this can be changed as needed.  
6. **Route Line Width**: Adjust the thickness of the route line on the map. This allows users to highlight routes or distinguish between different paths visually.
