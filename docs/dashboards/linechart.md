### Create a Line Chart

To create a Line Chart, first ensure that the dashboard is in **Edit Mode**.
Click on the '+ Add Widget' button, which will open a dialog box displaying all the available widgets.
Select the **Line Chart** option from the list.

This will open the **Create Line Chart** dialog, where you can configure the chart's settings and data sources. Let’s start by setting up a single data source.

1. **Value Name**: Enter the name of the value that will be used to fetch the messages.
2. **Channel**: Choose the channel connected to the device you want to track.
3. **Client**: Select the client (device/entity) connected to the specified channel.
4. **Label**: Provide a label to track each data source clearly on the chart.
5. **Line Color**: Use the color picker to choose the color for the line.

After configuring the data sources, you can define a **Time Window** by specifying the "From" and "To" dates to constrain the data within a specific time interval.

In the **Settings** tab, you can also adjust the **Line Width** to set the thickness of the lines, depending on your visual preference.

Once you're satisfied with your settings, click the **Create** button to save the Line Chart widget.
This will close the dialog and add the new Line Chart to your dashboard.

### Edit the Line Chart

You can edit the chart at any time by clicking the **Pencil Icon** on the widget. This will open a settings sheet on the right, where you can modify the chart’s data sources, labels, intervals, and title.

At this stage, you can also edit the labels, intervals, and chart title:

Clicking on Update button will save the changes and adjust the chart to match the new settings.
A confirmation message (toast notification) will appear to confirm the update has been applied.

This data can be further manipulated using the **Time Window** settings.
We can restrict the data shown to a specific interval for example an hour as shown in these settings:

This will adjust the chart to display data within the defined time frame, ensuring the final data point is at or before the specified _To_ date.

Additionally, you can apply **Aggregation** to the data points. Aggregation requires a "From" value, a "To" value, and an interval. These settings help structure the query to the database for aggregated data.

In the example above, the chart is set to show the **Maximum** value over 10-minute intervals within a 100-minute time window.

The resulting chart will look like this:

Aggregation options include:

- **Maximum**
- **Minimum**
- **Sum**
- **Count**
- **Average**
